# ‚öΩ eTipster ‚Äì Football Betting Odds Filter

eTipster is a Python script that uses the [API-FOOTBALL](https://www.api-football.com/) service to fetch daily football fixtures, filter teams based on recent goal-scoring history, and create a betting ticket with matches likely to hit **Over 1.5 goals**.

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ run.py         # Entry point to execute the program
```

| Variable        | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| `API_KEY`       | Your **API-FOOTBALL** API key (required). |
| `TZ`            | Timezone for fetching today's matches (default: `"Europe/Vatican"`). |
| `HEADERS`       | HTTP headers for API requests (includes API key). |
| `LEAGUES_ENABLED` | Set `True` to filter only specific leagues listed in `LEAGUES`. |
| `LEAGUES`       | List of league names to include (e.g. `["Serie C", "Serie D"]`). |
| `MIN_TOT_GOALS` | Minimum total goals in each of a team‚Äôs last matches to pass the filter. |
| `LAST_MATCHES_NUM` | Number of recent matches to evaluate per team. |
| `BOOKMAKER`     | Bookmaker ID (default `8` = Bet365). |

   ```

2. **Set API Key**  
   Edit `config.py` and place your API key:
   ```python
   API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"

## üèÜ How It Works
1. **Fetch Matches** ‚Äì Gets today‚Äôs upcoming fixtures (`getTodayMatches`).  
2. **Filter Teams** ‚Äì Checks each team‚Äôs recent matches. A team qualifies if it scored at least `MIN_TOT_GOALS` in all of its last `LAST_MATCHES_NUM` games (`filterMatches`).  
3. **Fetch Odds & Build Ticket** ‚Äì Retrieves **Over 1.5** odds from the bookmaker and creates a ticket whose cumulative odds reach the configured `MULTIPLIER` (`createTicket`).
